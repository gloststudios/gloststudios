Shipping and Returns
Items are calculated by weight and distance and are shipped using a courier. Once items have been shipped and a tracking email received, the seller is not responsible for loss or damages, within reason. Please ensure you are happy with a product before purchasing as returns are not accepted.
I create hand made products, so variation in finish and form is inevitable. Many products are made at the time of being ordered so reception of products may take up to four weeks to receive.
 
About Glost Studios
Glost is a small Melbourne based business by teacher and artist, Ciane. Her aesthetic draws from the female form and nature, using exaggerated shapes and muted colours. Each of her pieces are handmade, allowing for a vast degree of difference between forms. No two works are the same.
Her work ranges from humorous mugs and planters with female anatomy protruding, to cacoon like vessels that emulate a natural and feminine curve. Her sculptures reflect an internal conversation and acceptance of body image and the changes in ones perception of beauty, over time.
